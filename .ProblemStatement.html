<p><strong>Problem Definition</strong><br />This webapp has a typical Signup / SignIn page for users to sign up and login.<br />Once logged in, users can see a simple Home page and an Account page.<br />The Sign Up page has only the following fields currently:<br />1. Full Name<br />2. Email<br />3. Password<br />4. Confirm Password</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong><br />Add these additional fields to the Sign Up form and Account page:<br />1. Date of Birth (add validations for mm/dd/yyyy format too)<br />2. LinkedIn URL (add validations for valid web url too)</p>
<p>These fields should be mandatory during signup. User can then update them via the Account page.</p>
